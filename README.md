# Work Day Scheduler

# Goal
The goal of this project is to create a daily planner with hourly intervals which are color-coded to denote past, present, and future tasks. Tasks should be stored in local storage and be brought back upon refresh. The page will refresh itself every half hour so tasks do not creep up on the user without warning.

# Tools
In addition to HTML and some custom CSS, I've also implemented a number of Bootstrap classes and used JQuery to traverse the DOM and maintain status through browser refresh. MomentJS is in place to track the date at the top of the page as well as the current time as it pertains to the schedule itself. The save icon is from online directory FontAwesome.
